For the checkerscript: You can either have a directory that also is a
python module (as the example here) or a single python file. If you
need any auxiliary data, use the python module and place the data in
that directory:

checker/
 helloworld.py

or

checker/
  helloworld
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── mychecker.py
  ├── someimage.jpg
  ├── somescript.pl  
  └── somfile.json

The one and only language is python3. You can still use other
languages after consulting with the core team by placing a script in
there and calling that from python.

In any way the required interface is:

from $servicename import ServiceNameChecker
